# ratp-api

A modern API to get information from the RATP

## Requirements
- Node.js (at least 0.10)
- The RATP database extracted from the Android app

## Setup

Clone the repo and then install the npm modules
(as well as bunyan, used for logs):

```
git clone https://github.com/leoetlino/ratp-api.git
cd ratp-api
sudo npm -g install bunyan
npm install
```

Copy the sqlite3 database extracted from the RATP official Android app
into the application root dir.
The database is not bundled to prevent legal issues.

You can do this with `adb` and root access:

```
adb pull /data/data/com.fabernovel.ratp/databases/ratp.db ./source/
```

Alternatively, you can extract the database file from the APK
(which is just a special ZIP file).

Finally, start the app:

```
node bootstrap.js | bunyan -o short -L
```

## API documentation

The API is [documented in the wiki](https://github.com/leoetlino/ratp-api/wiki/API).

## Why a RATP API?

While the RATP has released some of their data, the official API is
pretty complex for basic, most useful endpoints, such as getting a list of
all stations, network-wide or on a specific line.

And then there's the **refusal** to make the real-time next stops API
and data from the [SIEL](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIEL_(m%C3%A9tro_de_Paris)) available
publicly. It even goes as far as threatening developers with legal actionâ€¦

This is for data that is supposed to be public, and
that is already available to the public. **Why?**

Given that web scraping is forbidden, ratp-api does not rely on the website,
but instead directly uses the API that powers the Android app.
No reverse engineering was performed on the APK file.
Only traffic sniffing was done on my own device and my own network.

Since I wanted a modern JSON API and there was none, I decided to
make my own and release it under an open-source license.
